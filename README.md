This project shows examples of how to read Apache Parquet files without using Apache Spark.

There are currently multiple different techniques in this codebase, but future edits will clean things up.

Much of this code is based on http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/index.php?source_dir=parquet-tools-master/src/main/java/parquet/tools/read/SimpleRecordConverter.java, and can be thought of as a port to Scala with some improvements.
